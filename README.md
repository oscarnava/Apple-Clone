# Course: HTML & CSS3
## Fourth Microverse project, apple-clone (Solo)

This is the first version of the fourth project for the Microverse training program.
It was developed by Oscar (aka. Monstruo) using basic html tags, and CSS styling.

It's a functional copy of an old version of the site [apple.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

Dynamic elements were not replicated (like the automatic growing of the search text input) and also the main text, that originally were  created using images, were replicated using a font that resembles the original one.

Also, I chose to use SASS for this project in order to better organize my CSS selectors and to have the flexibility of generating dynamic rules (for example, for the menu items).
